To get an idea of what you can do with php+-mode, you can get a description and 
list of keybindings/functions for php+-mode by typing:
    C-h m
when inside of a php+-mode file.

If you have existing projects, or would like to add a new one, you can add them
to the php-project list by running:
    M-x php-project-add

If you are starting a new project, you can use create the directories and add 
the new project to your php-project-list all at once by running:
    M-x zf-create-directory-structure

Notes:

There is a known issue with company-mode version 0.5.  If company mode isn't 
loading, or you get errors about pysmell or gtags, you need to remove the
gtags and pysmell backends from company-mode.  Cutomize the variable
`company-backends` and remove the lines for `company-pysmell` and 
`company-gtags`.

While you're at it, you can also add a User-Defined company backend to the
merged backends section of company-backends called `company-my-php-backend`.
This backend will check the php.net documentation for completions of php
keywords and such.

===============================================================================
CONFIGURATION

You can use the various "customize ..." options in the php+-mode menus to 
customize php+-mode.  Hopefully most of these customize options are 
self-explanatory.  For a full list of cutomize options, just browse through
each of the customize groups with `M-x customize-group`:

 

- php-completion
 - php-doc
 - php-format
 - php-parse
 - php-project
 - php-tags
 - php-test
 - php+-mode

***********
EXECUTABLES

You may need to tell emacs where various executables are.  For instance, if 
php, phpunit, or phpcs (if you use the latter two) are not on your operating 
system's execute path, you may need to customize the following variables to 
tell them explicitly where the executables are:

php-exectuable
phpcs-shell-command
phpmd-shell-command
phpunit-shell-command

************************
PROJECTS AND DIRECTORIES

To add a project to the projects list the easy way, run:
    M-x php-project-add
Alternatively, you can add projects manually by going to 
    PHP+ -> Project -> Customize Projects 
in the menu or by typing
    M-x customize-variable php-project-list

If you use customize, the main variable to setup here is the PHP Project List.
This is a list of directories on your computer that correspons with a set of
php files or project.

To setup a project, insert a new item in the list and fill in the fields:

Project Nickname - This is just a nickname for the project.
Project Directory - This is the base directory for the project.  For projects
    using the Zend Framework, this will typically be the directory where 
    application, library, etc, are.
Project TAGS File - This is the TAGS file for the project.
Extra TAGS Directories - A list of directories to include when generating the 
    project TAGS file.  You may want to put the Zend Framework directories here.
    Project directory is included by default.
PHPUnit Config File - This is the xml configuration file that phpunit will use
    when phpunit is run from php+-mode.
phpcs/phpmd Subdirectories - This is a list of directories which should be
    included when phpcs is run for the project directory.  
phpdoc overrides - these are project specific phpdoc information to include in
    doc blocks.  Project agnostic defaults can be set by customizing php-doc.
Zend Framework Global Namespace - This is the namespace of files generated 
    outside of modules (in the "main area" so to speak).  Traditionally, this 
    was "Default" but has recently more likely to be "Application".  This will 
    result in, for instance, models outside of modules being named 
    Default_Model_<name> or Application_Model_<name>.  (Only necessary for 
    projects using Zend Framework).
Zend Framework Default Module - This is the default module that will be used as
    default if the Zend project makes use of a default module in the modules
    directory instead of keeping default controllers, models, etc, inside the
    applications directory (not in modules).  (Only necessary for projects 
    using Zend Framework).

****
TAGS

Tags files are basically compiled files of symbols that link various files
together, allowing you, for instance, to find the definition of a function by
"following" its name in a call somewhere else in your code.  This is done in 
emacs using the find-tag function, bound to M-. by default.

In order to use tags, you have to do two things:

1.) Create a tags file
2.) Load the tags file

The php-tags portion of php+-mode eases this process.  It requires you to have 
exhuberant-ctags installed.  This is different from ctags.  Basically, in my
experience, if your ctags does not have a -e flag, you need to get 
exhuberant-ctags to use.  There is a customizable variable 
php-tag-shell-command where you can set the path to your ctags command if 
neccessary.

To create a tags file you can either go to
    PHP+ -> Tags -> Create tags file
in the menu, or run
    M-x php-create-tag-file

A tags file will be created in the location given in the php-project-list 
settings for the current project.  After the tags file is generated, you will 
be prompted to load the newly created tags file.

Once the tags files is created, php-project will automatically load it whenever
you switch to a file or buffer that resides inside that project's directory.

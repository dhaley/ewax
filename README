E-Wax emacs

A bodacious literate elisp instance of Eric Schulte's Emacs Starter Kit.

More power!

Here's what in the box:

* Org-mode 7.8.08 - how to organize your life and get things done...    
* Bernt Hansen GTD Org-Mode config (cowabunga, dude!)
* Ma Gnus v0.6 - the most powerful pop/IMAP/nntp client ever?
* BBDB 3.02 - the newest big brother for sucking up your contacts' email    
* ERC - powerful IRC client
* CLI like Tron would use - eterm and ani-term
* Solarized Color Theme
* El-get 3.1
* plus mo Rad Free Stuff
            
To use this config, you must first get Eric's starter kit implemented
in emacs 24 following these installation instructions:

http://eschulte.github.com/emacs24-starter-kit/

Or just do this:

% git clone http://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit.git .emacs.d

You can now start emacs and let the starter kit download it's required
packages from Marmalade.

While still in emacs 24, download the latest version of el-get devel:

Open up a scratch buffer and evaluate this lisp

 (url-retrieve
   "https://raw.github.com/dimitri/el-get/master/el-get-install.el"
   (lambda (s) (let (el-get-master-branch) (goto-char (point-max))
   (eval-print-last-sexp))))

It might take a while for el-get to clone itself, but when this
process is no longer in a ps listing, then you can close down emacs.

When el-get is done,

You should see this message:

"Congrats, el-get is installed and ready to serve!"

Okily Dokily!, now Download E-WAX

% cd ~/.emacs.d            
% git submodule add https://github.com/dhaley/ewax.git $USER
                      
Now, let's run the E-WAX install script.

% cd $USER
% ./install.sh    

This will take probably five to ten minutes while gnus and org-mode
download (and compile your .el into .elc).
    
When the script is finished, run emacs, which will download some stuff
with el-get.

You'll know el-get is done when you don't see any git clone action going on
in your process list.

% ps -ef | grep git
            
YOU'RE DONE!!!!!

HOPEFULLY!!!
